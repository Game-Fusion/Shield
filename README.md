# Shield
The future is now, with the Revolution Shield.

The Shield is a multimedia center full to the brim with features like vinyl and NBS music playback, file management, web browsing, gaming and more!

Full details:

• Revolution's "Denver" API is featured under the hood

• Will play games released natively for the console, along with streaming software from the cloud!

• Music support! Sporting an upgraded version of the SmartPlay series' Vinyl player - no graphix, less waiting and a bit faster in general because of optimisations - along with NBS playback

• A fluent, unique, tiled menu [thanks to Gonow32]

• Includes "Ice Browser" by Cutecurtain to browse/modify files in style

• Future proof - the system has been acknowledged by Revolution since 2015 and there's no plans to discontinue support for anyone seeking it, and the timeless design and up-to-date software ensures Shield will keep you powering through your work for years to come
