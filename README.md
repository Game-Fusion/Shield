# Shield
The future is now, with the Revolution Shield.

The Shield will be a multimedia center full to the brim with features like FunCast*, Vinyl Playing, NBS playing, File Browsing, surfing rednet (Firewolf) and more!

Full details:

• Runs under Revolution's new "Denver" API!

• Will play games released for the console

• Runs a modded version of the SmartPlay series' Vinyl player (100% degraphixed, less waiting times and a bit faster in general)

• Will play NBS files (whether using note or not, I'm not sure yet)

• Uses a snazzy menu with different tile options [thanks to Gonow32]

• Will use "Ice Browser" by Cutecurtain to browse/modify files in style

• Future proof - Rev have no plans to replace it anytime soon!

• And more unconfirmed details!
