The future is now, with the Revolution Shield.

The Shield is a multimedia center full to the brim with features like music playback, file management, web browsing, gaming and more!

Full details:

• Revolution's powerful "Denver" API is featured under the hood.

• Plays games that are released for it by disk, from the Shield Store or streamed via the Shield Cloud system! 

• Music support! Sporting an upgraded, optimised and fine-tuned version of the SmartPlay series' Vinyl player along with NBS playback.

• A fluent and dynamic tiled menu [thanks to Gonow32]

• Includes "Ice Browser" by Cutecurtain to browse/modify files in style

• Future proof - the system has been acknowledged by Revolution since 2015 and there's no plans to discontinue support for anyone seeking it, and the timeless design and reliable software ensures Shield will keep you powering through your work for years to come.
